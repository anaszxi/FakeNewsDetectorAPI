# Fake News Detection Model Improvement Report

## 1. Initial Model Performance

### 1.1 Base Model Metrics
The initial Random Forest model showed promising results on the training dataset:
```
Random Forest Performance:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       0.95      0.93      0.94     11640
           1       0.93      0.96      0.94     12165
    accuracy                           0.94     23805
```

```mermaid

    A[Training Data] --> B[Random Forest Model]
    B --> C[94% Accuracy]
    B --> D[0.94 F1-Score]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

- Overall Accuracy: 94%
- Balanced performance for both fake (0) and real (1) news
- Large training dataset: 23,805 samples

### 1.2 Initial Testing Issues
Despite good training metrics, the model struggled with real-world examples:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initial Model] --> B[Real News Test]
    A[Initial Model] --> C[Fake News Test]
    B --> D[68% Accuracy]
    C --> E[32% Accuracy]
    style A fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style E fill:#f66,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

Issues:
- Initial test accuracy: 50%
- Failed to identify obvious fake news patterns
- Showed bias towards classifying articles as real
- Confidence levels were misleading (high confidence in wrong predictions)

## 2. Model Improvements

    E --> G[Final Decision]
    F --> G
    style G fill:#9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

### 2.2 Text Feature Analysis
Added comprehensive text analysis system to extract key features:

```python
def extract_features(text):
    return {
        'exclamation_count': text.count('!'),
        'caps_ratio': sum(1 for c in text if c.isupper()) / len(text),
        'urgency_words': count_urgency_words(text),
        'conspiracy_words': count_conspiracy_words(text),
        'repeated_punct': count_repeated_punctuation(text),
        'caps_words_ratio': calculate_caps_words_ratio(text)
    }
```

### 2.3 Feature Importance
```mermaid

    title Feature Importance in Risk Score
    "CAPS Usage" : 35
    "Punctuation" : 20
    "Urgency Words" : 15
    "Conspiracy Language" : 15
    "Title Analysis" : 10
    "Text Length" : 5
```

### 2.4 Risk Scoring System
Implemented weighted risk scoring:
```python
risk_score = (
    title_features['exclamation_count'] * 2 +
    title_features['caps_ratio'] * 100 +
    title_features['urgency_words'] * 3 +
    title_features['conspiracy_words'] * 3 +
    title_features['repeated_punct'] * 3 +
    title_features['caps_words_ratio'] * 50
)
```
